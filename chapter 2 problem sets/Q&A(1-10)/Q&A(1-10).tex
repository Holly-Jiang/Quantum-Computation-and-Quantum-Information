\maketitle 


% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.


\begin{quote}
{\bf 练习 2.1(例子线性相关） 证明(1，一1)，（1，2)和(2，1)是线性相关的.}\\
  设A=$\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}$
B=$\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}$
C=$\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\end{bmatrix}$
让A B C 矩阵线性相关的条件就是存在不全为0的复数$\lambda_1$,$\lambda_2$,-1使得$\lambda_1A$+$\lambda_2B$-C=0，即：\\
$\lambda_1\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}$+
$\lambda_2\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}$-
$\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\end{bmatrix}$=
$\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$\\
$\lambda_1+\lambda_2$=2\\
-$\lambda_1+2*\lambda_2$=1    得\\
$\lambda_1$=1
$\lambda_2$=1\\
所以得到不全为0的$\lambda$序列让A B可以表示C，所以向量组A B C线性相关
